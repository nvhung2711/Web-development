// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var first = prompt("Enter the first number: ");
var second = prompt("Enter the second number: ");
first = Number(first);
second = Number(second);
var sum = first + second;
var diff = first - second;
var prod = first * second;
var quo = first / second;
alert("The sum of the two numbers are " + sum);
alert("The difference of the two numbers are " + diff);
alert("The product of the two numbers are " + prod);
alert("The quotient of the two numbers are " + quo);
